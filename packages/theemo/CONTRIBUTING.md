# Contribute to Theemo

I'm calling for your help to improve theemo. Spin it up for your project, consult the documentation and benefit from your now-faster-workflow.

Is the documentation good? Where it is unclear? What were your obstacles in understanding (parts of) it?

Are you using another tool than Figma or Style Dictionary? Maybe Sketch, Framer X or Adobe XD as your design tool? Or do you use Theo as your token manager tool? These are at the moment unfortunately all not included but I'd like to see support for them and good thing is the architecture of theemo already allows to plug-in extensions for other tools.

For all cases, please reach out to the theemo repository, open issues for
questions or discussion - or submit a PR =)
