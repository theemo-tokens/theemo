# `@theemo/tokens`

Packages contains types and utility functions to work with tokens and their
values.

## Installation

```sh
pnpm add -D @theemo/tokens
```

## Alernatives

This package is heavily influenced rsp. based on these:

- [`style-dictionary-utils` by Lukas
  Oppermann](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/style-dictionary-utils) - Can be
  used as substitute to this and `@theemo/style-dictionary` when none of the
  theemo features are used.
- [Design Token Tools by
  Knapsack](https://github.com/knapsack-labs/design-token-tools) - Very good to
  read and write tokens.
