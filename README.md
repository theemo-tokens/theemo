# Theemo - Design Token Automations

Theemo automates your design tokens by connecting your existing tools and make them work together, from design to framework integration. The theemo suite consists of multiple parts to serve a multi-disciplinary audience by bringing them together for an immersive workflow.

- Design: Automate Design in your Design Tool (eg. Figma).
- [CLI](./packages/theemo): Blend into your existing toolchain
- Frameworks: Integrate the generated design tokens into your framework of choice.
