There is a [glossary at Design Tokens Community
Group](https://www.designtokens.org/glossary/). Additional/further description
can be found here:

## Design Token

A design token, which has some properties. Please refer to the full
[token reference](api/theemo.token).

### Token Type

Theemo differentiates between three token _types_.

- `Basic` - A very low-level token, e.g. a color from your palette
- `Purpose` - A token given a _semantic meaning_, e.g. the _action_
  color (referencing to a `basic` token)
- `Component` - A token for a _specific_ use-case. E.g. The heading color for
  your hero component

Here are some references for you, that explain them in various ways:

## Scalable Design Tokens

In order to make design tokens scalable, their creation process needs to be
replicable. A [token specification](./token-specification.md) contains
the plan in form of a scheme in order to make them replicatable.

## Token User

Token users are [token designer](#token-designer) and [token consumer](#token-consumer).

## Token Designer

A token designer develops and designs tokens. The token design includes
references and possible transforms.

## Token Consumer

An end-user using a token either in design or code.

## Token Specification

[A formula for scalable design tokens](./token-specification.md).
