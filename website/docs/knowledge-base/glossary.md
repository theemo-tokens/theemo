## Token

A design token, which has some properties. Please refer to the full
[token reference](api/theemo.token).

### Token Type

Theemo differentiates between three token _types_.

- `Basic` - A very low-level token, e.g. a color from your palette
- `Purpose` - A token given a _semantic meaning_, e.g. the _action_
  color (referencing to a `basic` token)
- `Component` - A token for a _specific_ use-case. E.g. The heading color for
  your hero component

Here are some references for you, that explain them in various ways:
