Theemo automates your design tokens by connecting your existing tools
and make them work together, from design to framework integration. The theemo
suite consists of multiple parts to serve a multi-disciplinary audience by
bringing them together for an immersive workflow.

The suite addresses designers and developers and aims to make them
more productive. Theemo connects to the collaborating interfaces, guiding
through a structured process while allowing and adhering to an (already
existing) domain language.

## For Designers

Theemo enhances your workflow by providing automation to design tools and makes
your data available to developers.
Assisting you to stay in your most productive workflow and pave the way for
seemless transition to development.

Have a look at [design](design.md) section, what options are available.

## For Developers

Theemo assists your workflow by offering [toolchain support](toolchain.md)
to automate the data exchange with designers and integrates that output with
your [framework](frameworks.md) of choice.

Set up the automation once and then maintain it with the minimal amount possible.
