## API

Here is how to execute all tasks in order. Config is being picked up from
`cwd()`.

```ts

import config from './config';

const theemo = new Theemo(config);

theemo.sync();
theemo.generate();
```

Consult [API reference](../api/theemo) for [`sync()`](../api/theemo.theemo.sync)
and [`generate()`](../api/theemo.theemo.generate)
