Sync tokens from your [design tool](https://www.designtokens.org/glossary/#design-tool) to your [token translation
tool](https://www.designtokens.org/glossary/#design-token-translation-tool).
This process is split into three steps:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Reader [ ]
        RunReader[Reader] --> DescReader[Reads and parses your tokens]
    end

    subgraph Lexer [ ]
        RunLexer[Lexer] --> DescLexer[Understands your tokens]
    end

    subgraph Writer [ ]
        RunWriter[Writer] --> DescWriter[Writes them to disc]
    end

    Reader --> Lexer --> Writer

    classDef text stroke-width:0,fill:transparent
    class DescReader,DescLexer,DescWriter text
```

- [Reader](./sync/reader.md) - Reads the tokens read from your design tool and parses
  them into a unified format
- [Lexer](./sync/lexer.md) - Understands the tokens your way
- [Writer](./sync/writer.md) - Writes them to disc according to your generated
  knowledge in the format of your preferred token translation tool

All instructions go into your `theemo.js` file under the `sync` key:

```js
module.exports = {
  sync: {...}
}
```

You can reach out for a full [example config](./example-config.md).
