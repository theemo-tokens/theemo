**Q: Can I reference imported Styles?**

Partially...

...when using theemo plugin it can only show local styles as suggestions, that is
due to limitations of the current figma API, given security reasons for
shared team libraries. That's fair - Figma keeps us safe, give them credit for
that :)

It still is possible to use library styles, then you can't use the style
references manage dialog, instead manually assign those style and THEN use the
theemo dialog in order to persist it.

**Q: Can I use Multi Themed Components in various Projects?**

Yes. Have a look at [best practices for multi theme
components](./best-practices#multi-themed-components).
