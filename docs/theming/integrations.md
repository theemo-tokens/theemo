# Integrations

Theemo has an agnostic core to load themes with `@theemo/vite` and use
`@theemo/theme` to manage themes at runtime.

- [Vanilla JS/TS](./integrations/vanilla.md)

## Frameworks

Framework adapters provide reactive wrappers around `@theemo/theme`:

- [Ember](./integrations/ember.md)
- [Svelte](./integrations/svelte.md)
- [SvelteKit](./integrations/sveltekit.md)
- [Vue](./integrations/vue.md)

PRs are welcome, too.
