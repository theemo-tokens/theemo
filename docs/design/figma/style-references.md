# Style References

Theemo started out as a way to reference styles, and that functionality still
exists. Very important in the early days were colors, but nowadays text and
effect styles are still supported, while variables took over for colors (but
Theemo still provides [transforms](./transforms.md)).

In order to reference one style onto another, open Theemo, find the style you
are looking for and select the reference.

Keep Theemo open to receive automatic updates as you change the origin styles.
