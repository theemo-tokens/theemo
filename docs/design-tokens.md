# Design Tokens

## Understanding Design Tokens

[Traits](./design-tokens/traits.md)\
Traits are inherent to tokens given their technical nature in which they are
used. Traits describe their _behavior_ as well as their stimulating triggers
(_principals_) and the nerves (_agents_) who transport those signals.

[Features](./design-tokens/features.md)\
Features encode user preferences (e.g. color scheme or color contrast) and
provide customization options for a delightful user experience.

[Internals](./design-tokens/internals.md)\
Tokens not only have a name and a value, they carry on a lot more data, which
when given proper meaning is a knowledgeable resource.

## Using Tokens

[Modeling & Communication](./design-tokens/modeling.md)\
Design system architecture with focus on design tokens, that form the
vocabulary of your visual design language, helping to streamline the
communication amongst stakeholders. Modeling the system with boundaries to
ensure clear purpose and predictability for design tokens and stability
guarantees with fine control for theme authors.

[The Three Class Token Society](./design-tokens/three-class-token-society.md)\
Design tokens are often grouped based on their phenomenal reference sequence.
From basic, over semantic to component tokens. This article compares this
organization with a model based architecture and figures out the advantages
and disadvantages.

[Put Your Tokens on a Scale](./design-tokens/scales.md)\
Ever worked with a set of design tokens that are super inconsistent and hardly
distinguishable? Perhaps a wrong scale? This article explains the available
scales, their problems and what to use them for.

[Token Specification](./design-tokens/token-specification.md)\
Design tokens become scalable when they are replicable. A token specification
is a formula for achieving design tokens scalability and tools
interoperability.

[Naming](./design-tokens/naming.md)\
Naming design tokens can sometimes be considered its own discipline. Naming is
surprisingly straight forward, and if it isn't then it solves the wrong
problem.

[Theming](./design-tokens/theming.md)\
Theming in Design Systems is a de-facto standard way to exchange the
look-and-feel of your product. There is a high divergence of what is a theme?
What does it consist of? Which constraints exists when building a theme? When
and what to use a theme for?
