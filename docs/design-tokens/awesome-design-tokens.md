# Awesome Design Tokens

Go by this:

1. Define the _topics_ relevant to your design language to [model your tokens and
  establish a communication](./modeling.md).
2. Give purpose to your tokens (avoid semantics, that term is overloaded).
  Speaking about purpose results in much more clarity
3. Ignore the type of a token. The type is inherent of a token, but stop thinking in
  terms of types or making them part of your name leads you to properly think
  about the purpose of it.
4. Formalize this into a [token specification](./token-specification.md) to make it scalable.
5. [Naming follows naturally](./naming.md) when applying the steps above.
