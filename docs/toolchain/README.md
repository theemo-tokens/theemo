Theemo will do the following:

- **Sync** from your Design Tool to your Token Translation Tool
- Trigger the **build** of your Token Translation Tool
- **Generates** a ready-to-consume, adoptive CSS theme
- Use one or all features

Theemo will **integrate** into your existing **toolchain** by **connecting**
multiple parts together.
